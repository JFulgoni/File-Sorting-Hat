# File-Sorting-Hat
## John Fulgoni
This program is made to take a file, potentially analyze the contents of a given file system.
The first plan is to use if-else statements, and eventually use word analysis to determine where the file should be moved to.
Right now it's entirely used from the command line terminal.
